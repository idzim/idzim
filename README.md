## Welcome on My Github! ðŸ˜º

Currently, I'm working as a Software Tester, mostly manual one, but I like to automize tasks, whatever I can. I do it mostly to optimize my daily work and develop myself with automation tools. 
Why? Because:
- I like do things in a efficient way
- I love to learn new things
- I like to put a some effort to minimalize work to do in the future (for myself and other people)
- I like to finding disfunctional things and bugs

In my work I use: **SQL**, **Playwright**, **Azure DevOps**, **ISTQB**

I also studing Computer Science, where I am learning about diffrent fields of Software Develelopment, how to use programming languages (**C#**, **Javacript**), working with Databases (**Postgres**, **MySQL**, **SQLServer**) and also build a website applications using **HTML** and **CSS**.


After hours I love coooking, board games and cats.
